Design and Build Database for a Tinyhub - Student Application

Based on the application design document, we analyzed data flow in the application and designed the entity-relationship model, 
which explains how data is stored for the given application and how different conditions are handled using the schema level constraints.

Based on the ER model, a database is created along with a data dictionary document explaining the table structure
and how certain conditions to be handled at the application level and the batch level.

1. Built multiple versions of the ER model. On every change in the application detail, the ER was revised and 
   modified to include incremental changes
2. Once the ER model is finalized, then database design was easy as ER provided a roadmap for the schema creation
3. After the database is designed, mandated some validations and handling at the application level to have data consistency across the database


This Repository includes database creation script(MYSQL Server), report explaining ER diagram and data dictionary.
